      The Zodiac was split into twelve sections, each named after the specific constellation noted in that area. Elements: Many ancient philosophies used a set of classical elements to explain the way nature behaved. Each sign was connected to one of the classical elements (fire, earth, air, or water) and was also related to a region of focus; social, personal or universal.
