    description: "There's a big push for Offline First development, with a new buzzword — 'Progressive Web App', or PWA — making the rounds for the last year or two. But a lot of what's being said sounds like the coding equivalent of 'eat your vegetables!' What's in it for ME? Quite a bit, it turns out. In this workshop, you'll learn the surprising ways that online apps will see huge benefits when they're built to support offline users. Learn how to ace Google's progressive web app test, Lighthouse, with just a few simple changes, and how you can easily create Offline First apps with just a few lines of code. Learn how going Offline First will improve the connected experience, including: better performance, increased stability and reliability, improved user experience and more! So in addition to eating your vegetables — you know, making your web apps usable for people with slow and unreliable connections or whatever — you'll ALSO see your apps get even better for connected users. And all with minimal development effort required."
