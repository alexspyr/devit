- title: "Xamarin and Azure - Build the mobile apps of tomorrow"
  description: "<p>It’s hard to be a developer and not have heard of Xamarin. It’s now part of Microsoft’s
    ‘Any developer, any platform’ strategy, and allows you to write C# and F# code that runs on iOS and
    Android. Combined with the power of the cloud, you can easily build the mobile apps of tomorrow that
    your users will love. In fact, we are so sure you are going to love Xamarin we're going to teach
    you how build an app to share photos of happy Xamarin developers. </p><p>This workshop will take you from
    0 to a fully working, cloud connected, AI powered mobile app. We'll get you setup with Visual Studio
    and the Xamarin tooling on either Windows or Mac, and connect up your iPhone or Android device to
    Xamarin Live Player ready to run an app. Once you are set up we'll cover the basics of Xamarin and
    Xamarin.Forms, then it's heads down writing a cross-platform app - using one code base for a
    fully-native app that runs on both iOS and Android.</p><p>The app we build will combine accessing device
    hardware using Xamarin plugins, AI for face and emotion detection and cloud services like authentication
    and blob storage, all built using a serverless architecture. Finally we'll go from code to production
    ready, using Visual Studio App Center to build your app, monitor for crashes, gather analytics, and
    prepare you app for distribution. We'll even look at wiring up push notifications so your app can be
    notified when someone else uploads a photo. </p><p>By the end of the day you will have a production ready,
    AI and cloud powered mobile app.</p>"
